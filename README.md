Working of the Project
The working of this project can be observed through real-time performance data and visibility changes on Amazon. Here’s how it functions in a live environment:
 1. Keyword Visibility on Amazon Search
After optimizing the product listing with high-ranking keywords and launching PPC campaigns:
When a customer searches a targeted keyword on Amazon(https://www.amazon.com), the product appears in the search results. It may show up in: Sponsored section (top or middle) — due to PPC ads Organic search result — due to SEO improvements in the listing
This demonstrates that the optimisation and ad targeting are effectively increasing product visibility.

2. PPC Campaign Tracking via Seller Central
The impact of the project is also visible through Campaign Manager in Amazon Seller Central:
(https://advertising.amazon.com/campaign-manager?entityId=ENTITY1QT4DFAN7ADAE)
Go to: Advertising → Campaign Manager
There, sellers can track: Impressions: How many people saw the ad Clicks & CTR: How many clicked on it Sales & Orders: What sales came through ads ACoS (Advertising Cost of Sale): Shows if the ad is profitable CPC (Cost Per Click): Helps monitor ad spend efficiency
Improvements or declines in performance can be analysed through these reports.

3. Performance Comparison (Before vs. After)
By comparing data before and after optimisation:
Increased impressions and click-through rate (CTR) show that the product is more visible and engaging
A drop in ACoS and rise in sales indicate more efficient and profitable ads

This provides measurable proof of the effectiveness of listing optimisation and PPC strategy.
